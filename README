Simple program to fill all RTP media payload data with 0xff to protect privacy.

Depends on libpcap.

To build just run make.

Usage: ./blank_rtp in.pcap out.pcap

Note: The checks on the RTP are weak so it could easily mistake some other UDP
protocol as RTP, so it would be better to run on a pcap that has just RTP and merge
later. SIP with RTP should be safe as SIP is ascii.
